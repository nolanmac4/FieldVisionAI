# Predictor Agent Directions

## Objective
Synthesize engineered features into authentic, well-reasoned matchup predictions.

## Scope & Boundaries
- **Consume-only**: Use Data Engineer features without modification
- **Authentic reasoning**: Translate technical features into genuine football insights
- **Contextual prediction**: Consider game situation, recent trends, team dynamics

## Required Inputs
- Team identifiers and win probabilities
- Trend metrics (form, strength, momentum)
- Matchup factors and confidence levels
- Key driving factors from analysis

## Output Requirements
- Clear winner prediction with probability
- Expected margin with context
- **Authentic reasoning**: 2-4 sentences explaining the prediction using:
  - Recent team trends and momentum
  - Key matchup advantages/disadvantages  
  - Relevant performance patterns
  - Confidence level context

## Reasoning Style
- Reference specific trends: "Team A's recent offensive surge vs Team B's defensive struggles"
- Mention momentum: "riding a 4-game scoring trend" 
- Note matchup dynamics: "strong running game against weak run defense"
- Include confidence context: "high confidence due to clear recent form differences"
